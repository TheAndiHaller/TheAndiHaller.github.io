          Meet Tridibot: The 3D Printed Robot That You Can Control Over Wifi
        </p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Have you ever dreamed of having your own robot companion? A robot that
          can walk and even play soccer? Well, dream no more! In this blog post,
          I will introduce you to Tridibot, a 3D printed robot that is
          controlled over wifi from any device. Tridibot is a fun and
          educational project that anyone can build and customize. Let me tell
          you how it all started.

        <p class="project-subtitle">The Origin of Tridibot</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Tridibot was born out of a challenge. My friend Konrad and I are both
          passionate about robotics and 3D printing. We love to tinker with
          different gadgets and create new things. One day, we were contacted by
          a teacher from the University of La Punta, who asked us if we could
          build a robot that could help him in his classroom. He wanted a robot
          that could interact with his students, teach them some basic concepts
          of robotics and programming, and also entertain them with some games.
        </p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          We accepted the challenge and started brainstorming ideas. We decided
          to make a robot that had four legs instead of wheels because we
          thought it would be more agile and expressive. We also wanted to make
          it wireless so that it could be controlled from any device without
          cables or wires. And we wanted to make it affordable and accessible so
          that anyone could replicate it with common materials and tools.
        </p>
        <img
          alt="Robot"
          class="project-image-big"
          src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dzdh345nq/image/upload/v1677709375/git/IMG_20180515_212719_afpugx.jpg"
        />
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          We chose to use an ESP8266 and an Arduino nano as the
          micro-controllers for Tridibot. The ESP8266 is a tiny board that has
          wifi capabilities and can communicate with any device over the
          internet. The Arduino nano is a small board that can control servos
          and sensors. We connected them using serial communication and wrote
          the code using Arduino IDE.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          We wanted Tridibot to be rechargeable so we used a lithium-ion battery
          pack and a charging module. We also added an on/off switch and an LED
          RGB ring for feedback.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The best part about Tridibot is that it is open source. That means
          anyone can download the files, print their own parts, assemble their
          own robot, and modify it as they wish. We have uploaded all the files
          on GitHub and Thingiverse along with detailed instructions on how to
          build your own Tridibot.
        </p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Tridibot is more than just a toy. It is a learning platform that can
          teach you about robotics, electronics, programming, 3D printing, and
          more. It is also a fun way to interact with your friends or family
          over wifi. You can control your Tridibot from your phone, tablet,
          laptop, or any other device that has a web browser.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          We are very proud of what we have created and we hope you will enjoy
          it too. If you want to learn more about Tridibot or build your own
          please visit the Github repository
